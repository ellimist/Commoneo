#####Description
Commoneo is a very simple PHP based script that does only one thing: it stores your ideas.
<br>
It is fully responsive and it adapts itself depending on the device you're using (you don't want to loose that cool idea you got in the bus, do you?).

#####Security
There is no security implementation whatsoever. If you make it public, it can be accessed by anyone. Add your own login handler or **htaccess** configuration to keep it safe.
<br>
The data is saved in a random file everytime, although it makes no difference as long as you keep the app itself public. **Got a proper solution** in mind on how to handle security? I'll be waiting for your **pull requests**.

#####Installation
Just drop it on your host and you're ready to go. Make sure you read the **Security** section above first.

#####Make it better
Commoneo is far from being ready. Help it grow with nice **features**, break it and submit **fixes**, **expand it** and give back to the community.
